# Python Data Analysis Portfolio
Here is my collection of work throughout my learning journey understanding Python, syntax, and using functions to develop insights from a range of data sources.  

To support my learning and development, I have broken by portfolio into a sections covering different topics and technologies used such as Python, SQL and DBML. 

 # Python Notebooks 

Python Notebooks will be broken down into three key sections:

 1. **Data Analysis** - Developing my use of industry-wide tools, functions and technologies such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) centred around subjects that are of interest to me. 

 2. **Data Engineering** - Developing my understanding and practical application of engineering principles, planning and data pipeline development.  

3. **Applications** - Developing my understanding of syntax, project design and ultimately build practical things to maintain motivation and understand the wider practical use of Python within the technology landscape. 

## Applications 
 
 [Weather Application](https://github.com/ElliottFairhall/Python-Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Weather_Application.ipynb) - A breakdown of using Python to conduct HTML scraping, storing this information and providing a simple simple way to gather weather information based on a users input about their city.
